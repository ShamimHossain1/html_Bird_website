                  <p>The Red-bellied Woodpecker exhibits a striking appearance with a pale, cream-colored belly and a distinctive red patch on the nape of its neck. Despite its name, the red on its belly is often difficult to see. Males and females are similar in appearance, though males generally have a slightly more extensive red crown.</p>

                  <p>This species is widespread across the eastern United States, extending from the Atlantic coast to the Great Plains and from southern Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. The Red-bellied Woodpecker prefers deciduous forests, mixed woodlands, and urban areas with large trees. It is a non-migratory bird, though some may move short distances in winter in search of food.</p>

                  <p>Red-bellied Woodpeckers are known for their loud calls and distinctive drumming on tree trunks, which they use to communicate and to forage for insects. Their diet is highly varied and includes insects, spiders, fruits, nuts, seeds, and occasionally small vertebrates. They are also known to visit bird feeders, especially in winter.</p>

                  <h2>Reproduction</h2>
                  <p>Breeding occurs in the spring, with pairs forming monogamous bonds that often last for several years. They nest in tree cavities, which they excavate themselves or take over from other species. The female typically lays 4-5 eggs, which both parents incubate for about 12 days. Both parents also share the responsibility of feeding the chicks until they fledge at about 24-27 days old.</p>

                  <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
                  <p>The Red-bellied Woodpecker is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. Its population is stable and even increasing in some areas due to its adaptability to suburban environments. However, habitat loss and competition with invasive species like the European Starling can pose localized threats.</p>
